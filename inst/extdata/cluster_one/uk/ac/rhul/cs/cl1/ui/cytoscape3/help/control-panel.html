<div class="document" id="clusterone-cytoscape-plugin"><div class="section" id="control-panel">
<h1>Control panel</h1>
<p>The control panel of ClusterONE is to be found on a separate tab in the
control panel of Cytoscape (see the left hand side of the Cytoscape user
interface). The panel consists of two large parts: the <a href="control-panel.html#parameters">Parameters</a> box lets
you set the parameters of the algorithm (this is subdivided into <a href="control-panel.html#basic-parameters">Basic
parameters</a> and <a href="control-panel.html#advanced-parameters">Advanced parameters</a>), while the <a href="control-panel.html#selection-info">Selection info</a> box lets
you examine some properties of the currently selected set of nodes (such as the
total weight of edges within the set and at the boundary of the set, or the
value of the ClusterONE quality function).</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Start</strong> button at the bottom of the panel to start the clustering
process. The <a href="result-viewer.html">result viewer</a> will open automatically when the results are ready.
Use the <strong>Close panel</strong> button to hide the ClusterONE control panel.</p>
<p>After a successful clustering process, the nodes of the network will be colored
according to the number of clusters they participate in. Nodes that correspond
to a single cluster only will turn red, nodes with multiple clusters will turn
yellow. Gray nodes denote outliers (nodes that did not end up in any of the
clusters).  This coloring is implemented using a custom VizMapper style. The
style is selected automatically when the clustering process finishes, but you
can always return to your original style in the VizMapper panel of Cytoscape.</p>
<a name="parameters"/><div class="section" id="parameters">
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>The parameters are grouped into basic and advanced ones. In most of the cases,
the default values of the advanced parameters should be fine, but the basic
parameters may need to be adjusted to your specific needs.</p>
<a name="basic-parameters"/><div class="section" id="basic-parameters">
<h3>Basic parameters</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Minimum size</strong></dt>
<dd>The minimum size of clusters deemed relevant by ClusterONE.
This is a hard threshold: whenever ClusterONE finds a cluster
smaller than the minimum size, the cluster will be discarded
immediately.</dd>
<dt><strong>Minimum density</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">The minimum density of clusters deemed relevant by ClusterONE.
The density of a cluster is the total sum of edge weights within
the cluster, divided by the number of theoretically possible
edges within the cluster. In other words, this is the average edge
weight within the cluster if missing edges are assumed to have a
weight of zero. Whenever ClusterONE finds a cluster that has a
smaller density than the value given here, the cluster will be
discarded immediately. Increase the minimum density if you get
too many clusters and they seem too sparse, or decrease it if you
are not getting enough clusters.</p>
<p class="last">Since version 0.93, ClusterONE also includes an automatic density
threshold selection method, which was tuned on various protein-protein
interaction datasets. When the &quot;Auto&quot; value is selected in the minimum
density field (this can be selected by trying to choose a density
threshold smaller than zero), ClusterONE will use a density threshold
of 0.3 for weighted networks and 0.5 for unweighted networks. If the
network is unweighted and the global clustering coefficient is smaller
than 0.1, ClusterONE will assume that the network was determined from
low-throughput experimental data (e.g., yeast-two-hybrid experiments)
and use a higher threshold of 0.6 to compensate for the presence of
many tree-like subgraphs in the input.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Edge weights</strong></dt>
<dd>A numeric edge attribute to be used for the edge weights. <em>[unweighted]</em>
means that each edge will have a weight equal to 1. If you don't see the
name of the attribute in the list, click on the <strong>Refresh</strong> button
(<img alt="refresh" src="images/refresh.png"/>) next to the combo box to re-scan the network for numeric edge
attributes. This is necessary when you added the edge attribute you are
looking for after you opened the ClusterONE control panel.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<a name="advanced-parameters"/><div class="section" id="advanced-parameters">
<h3>Advanced parameters</h3>
<p>If you do not see these parameters in the <a href="control-panel.html">control panel</a>, click on the
<strong>Advanced parameters</strong> label to expand the container holding them.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Node penalty</strong></dt>
<dd>Penalty value corresponding to each node. When you set this option to
a specific value <em>x</em>, ClusterONE will assume that each node has an
extra boundary weight of <em>x</em> when it considers the addition of the node
to a cluster (see <a href="references.html#id5" id="id2">[1]</a> for more details). It can be used to model the
possibility of uncharted connections for each node, so nodes with only
a single weak connection to a cluster will not be added to the cluster as
the penalty value will outweigh the benefits of adding the node. The
default penalty value is 2.</dd>
<dt><strong>Merging method</strong>, <strong>Overlap threshold</strong> and <strong>Similarity function</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">After an initial set of clusters are found, ClusterONE tries to
merge highly overlapping (and thus redundant) clusters in order to
clean up the result. For each pair of clusters found, ClusterONE
calculates a score that quantifies the overlap between them, and
two clusters are merged if this overlap is larger than a given
threshold (specified by the <strong>Overlap threshold</strong> textbox). There
are four different ways to calculate the overlap score, as controlled
by the <strong>Similarity function</strong> combobox:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>match coefficient</em> takes the size of the overlap squared,
divided by the product of the sizes of the two clusters being
considered, as in the paper of Bader and Hogue <a href="references.html#id6" id="id3">[2]</a>.</li>
<li>The <em>Simpson coefficient</em> divides the size of the overlap
by the size of the smaller cluster.</li>
<li>The <em>Jaccard similarity</em> divides the size of the overlap by the
size of the union of the two clusters.</li>
<li>The <em>Dice similarity</em> divides twice the size of the overlap by
the sum of the sizes of the two clusters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Merging can be done in two different ways, as controlled by the
<strong>Merging method</strong> combobox:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>single-pass method</em> calculates similarity scores between all pairs
of complexes and creates a graph where the nodes are the
complexes and two nodes are connected if the corresponding
complexes have a score higher than the overlap threshold.
Complexes in the same connected component of the graph will then
be merged.</li>
<li>The <em>multi-pass method</em> calculates similarity scores between all pairs
of complexes and stores those pairs that have a score
larger than the overlap threshold. The highest scoring pair
is then merged and the similarity of the merged complex
towards its neighbors is re-calculated. This is repeated
until there are no more highly overlapping complexes in
the result.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="last">The default settings (match coefficient with a threshold of 0.8 using
the single-pass algorithm) seem to be satisfactory for most use-cases
Decreasing the threshold will result in more clusters being merged.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Seeding method</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">ClusterONE works by growing clusters from initial &quot;seeds&quot;, driven
by a goal function that is maximized greedily (see the Cluster
ONE paper <a href="references.html#id5" id="id4">[1]</a> for more details). A seed can be an arbitrary subgraph,
but in most cases, it is either a single node or a single edge.
The seeding method prescribes how the seeds are selected during the
calculation:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>From every node</em> means that every node will be used as a seed.</li>
<li><em>From unused nodes</em> means that nodes will be tried in the
descending order of their weights (where the weight of a node is
the sum of the weights on its incident edges), and whenever a
cluster is found, the nodes in that cluster will be excluded from
the list of potential seeds. In other words, the node with the
largest weight that does <em>not</em> participate in any of the clusters
found so far will be selected as the next seed.</li>
<li><em>From every edge</em> means that every edge will be considered once,
each yielding a seed consisting of the two endpoints of the edge.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="last">In practical use-cases, the <em>From unused nodes</em> and <em>From every node</em>
methods are almost equivalent, but the former one yields a smaller
number of redundant clusters.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<a name="selection-info"/><div class="section" id="selection-info">
<h2>Selection info</h2>
<p>The quantities shown in this box always correspond to the currently selected
set of nodes in the current Cytoscape view.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Number of nodes</strong></dt>
<dd>The number of nodes in the cluster.</dd>
<dt><strong>In-weight</strong></dt>
<dd>The sum of the weights of the edges that lie completely within the cluster.</dd>
<dt><strong>Out-weight</strong></dt>
<dd>The sum of the weights of the edges where one endpoint lies within the cluster
and the other lies outside.</dd>
<dt><strong>Density</strong></dt>
<dd>The density of the cluster; that is, the sum of the edge weights within
the cluster divided by the number of theoretically possible edges.</dd>
<dt><strong>Quality</strong></dt>
<dd>The quality of the cluster, as measured by the in-weight divided by the
sum of the in-weight and the out-weight. The rationale behind this measure
is that a good cluster contains many heavyweight edges within the cluster
itself, and it is connected to the rest of the network only by a few lightweight
edges. If the penalty value set in the <a href="control-panel.html#advanced-parameters">Advanced parameters</a> panel is larger
than zero, the out-weight of the cluster will be increased by the penalty
value times the number of nodes in the cluster accordingly.</dd>
<dt><strong>P-value</strong></dt>
<dd>The p-value of a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test performed on the in-weights
and out-weights of the vertices. A low p-value means that the in-weights
are significantly larger than the out-weights, so it is more likely that the
cluster is a valid finding and not the result of random fluctuations.
Color codes also help distinguishing significant results from insignificant
ones: p-values less than 0.05 are denoted by red colors and p-values
between 0.05 and 0.1 are shown in yellow.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the Mann-Whitney U test cannot be performed sensibly when all the
in-weights and out-weights are equal. In this case, the p-value will show &quot;NA&quot;.</p>
