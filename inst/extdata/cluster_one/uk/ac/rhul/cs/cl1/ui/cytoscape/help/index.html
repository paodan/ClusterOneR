<h1>The one-minute guide to using ClusterONE</h1>
<p>ClusterONE is distributed in a Java archive file (JAR), which contains both
the command line application and the Cytoscape plugin. In this document, we
are assuming that you want to use ClusterONE from the Cytoscape graphical
user interface. If you are interested in the command line interface, please
refer to the documentation distributed with the command line interface itself.</p>
<p>ClusterONE can be installed from the Cytoscape plugin manager. Launch
Cytoscape if you have not done so, click on the <strong>Manage plugins</strong> item of the
<strong>Plugins</strong> menu, select the <strong>Analysis</strong> subgroup within the <strong>Available for
install</strong> category, select the line starting with <strong>ClusterONE</strong> and click on
the <strong>Install</strong> button. Cytoscape should download and install the selected
version of ClusterONE for you. If you see more than one version of Cluster
ONE, make sure you install the most recent one. If you don't see any Cluster
ONE version, first check whether you have installed it already (look for a
menu called <strong>ClusterONE</strong> within the <strong>Plugins</strong> submenu), and if you
haven't, check the <strong>Show outdated plugins</strong> checkbox in the <strong>Manage plugins</strong>
dialog.</p>
<p>If you managed to install ClusterONE successfully, you should see a new menu
item called <strong>ClusterONE</strong> in the <strong>Plugins</strong> submenu. Now, do the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Load the network you wish to analyse into Cytoscape.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Plugins/ClusterONE/Start</strong> to start ClusterONE. This will add
a new panel called <strong>ClusterONE</strong> to the control panels on the left.</li>
<li>If your network is weighted, select the name of the weight attribute on the
ClusterONE control panel next to <strong>Edge weights</strong>. If you do not see the
desired attribute name, click on the <strong>Refresh</strong> button (<img alt="refresh" src="images/refresh.png" />) next to
the combo box.  If you still do not see it, make sure that the attribute is
registered in Cytoscape as a numeric attribute and not a string.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Start</strong> button at the bottom of the panel. ClusterONE should
detect the densely connected regions of your network and list them in a
new panel on the Cytoscape result panel, which is usually on the right hand
side of the window.</li>
<li>Clicking on a cluster in the result panel will highlight the cluster in the
network view. Double-clicking on a cluster will extract it as a new
subnetwork. Right-clicking on a cluster will bring up a context menu with
additional operations that you might find useful.</li>
<li>When you are finished with analysing the results, click on the <strong>Close</strong>
button (<img alt="close" src="images/close.png" />) in the upper right corner of the result panel.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="description-of-the-algorithm">
<h1>Description of the algorithm</h1>
<p>ClusterONE strives to discover densely connected and possibly overlapping
regions within the Cytoscape network you are working with. The interpretation
of these regions depends on the context (i.e. what the network represents) and
it is left up to you. For instance, in protein-protein interaction networks
derived from high-throughput AP-MS experiments, these dense regions usually
correspond to protein complexes or fractions of them. ClusterONE works by
&quot;growing&quot; dense regions out of small seeds (typically one or two vertices),
driven by a quality function called <em>cohesiveness</em>.</p>
<p>Before we move on to the formal definition of cohesiveness, let us introduce
some terminology that classifies vertices and edges of a graph <em>G</em> according to
their relationship to a selected group of vertices V<sub>0</sub>. Vertices of V<sub>0</sub> are
called <em>internal vertices</em>, while vertices not in V<sub>0</sub> are called <em>external
vertices</em>.  An edge that is situated between two internal vertices is an
<em>internal edge</em>, an edge going between an internal and an external vertex is a
<em>boundary edge</em>, and an edge between two external vertices is an <em>external
edge</em>. An internal vertex incident on at least one boundary edge is an
<em>internal boundary vertex</em>, while an external vertex incident on at least one
boundary edge is an <em>external boundary vertex</em>. The following figure illustrates
these concepts:</p>
<img alt="images/cohesive_subgroup.png" src="images/cohesive_subgroup.png" />
<p>Here, V<sub>0</sub> itself is denoted by a shaded background, which delimits internal
and external vertices. Thick black edges are internal, thin black edges are
boundary edges, while thin gray dashed edges are completely external. Vertices
marked by a letter are (internal or external) boundary vertices.</p>
<p>The quality of the group can be assessed by the number of internal edges
divided by the sum of the number of internal and boundary edges. This quality
measure is driven by the fact that a well-defined group should have many
internal edges and only a few boundary edges; in other words, the boundary
of the group should be sharp. If the edges have weights (i.e. a numeric value
assigned to each edge that quantifies how reliable that edge is or how confident
we are in its existence), the same guidelines apply, but the number of edges
should be replaced by the total confidence associated to those edges. Whenever
you have such confidence values, store them in a numeric edge attribute in
Cytoscape and use that attribute to drive the cluster growth process. From now
on, such confidence values will simply be called <em>edge weights</em> and the above
mentioned quality measure will be referred to as <em>cohesiveness</em>.</p>
<p>ClusterONE essentially looks for groups of high cohesiveness. This is achieved
by adopting a greedy strategy: starting from a single seed vertex (or a small
set of vertices that are strongly bound together), one can extend the group
step by step with new vertices so that the newly added vertex always increases
the cohesiveness of a group as much as possible. Removals are also allowed if
removing a vertex from the group increases its cohesiveness. The process stops
when it is not possible to increase the cohesiveness of the group by adding
another external boundary vertex or removing an internal boundary vertex.  See
the ClusterONE paper <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[1]</a> for the description of the exact procedure.  The
growth process is repeated either for every vertex or every connected vertex
pair to obtain an initial set of cohesive subgroups. Subgroups smaller than a
given size or having a density less than a given threshold are thrown away.
Finally, redundant cohesive subgroups (i.e. those that overlap significantly
with each other) are merged to form larger subgroups to make the results easier
to interpret.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-clusterone-menu">
<h1>The ClusterONE menu</h1>
<p>ClusterONE installs itself into the Plugins menu of Cytoscape under
a submenu named <strong>ClusterONE</strong>. This submenu has the following items:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Start</strong></dt>
<dd>Shows the <a class="reference internal" href="#control-panel">control panel</a> of ClusterONE, which is the main entry
point to the clustering algorithm implemented in ClusterONE.</dd>
<dt><strong>Grow cluster from selected nodes</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Grows a single cluster according to the steps of the ClusterONE algorithm,
starting from the selected nodes which will be treated as a single seed set.
For more details about the growth process, please refer to the
<cite>description of the algorithm</cite>. The resulting cluster will be selected
after the growth process is finished. Since the original selection will
be lost, you might consider using the <strong>NamedSelection</strong> Cytoscape
plugin (available from Plugins -&gt; Manage plugins) to remember the
original selection.</p>
<p class="last">This menu item remains disabled until you start the ClusterONE plugin
using the corresponding menu item.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Color nodes by affinity</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">Colors the nodes of the network according to their affinity to the
currently selected set of nodes as a cluster. Nodes with a positive
affinity to the cluster will be colored red, negative affinities will
be shown using shades of blue. The affinity of a node tells us how much
would the addition of that node increase the quality of the cluster.
You can use this menu item to drive the cluster growth process manually
by starting from a small seed cluster and repeatedly adding nodes to
the cluster that increase the quality function the most. Note that
you will have to recalculate the affinities every time you modify the
cluster, ClusterONE won't do that automatically.</p>
<p>Node coloring is implemented using a custom VizMapper style. This style
is selected automatically when you click on this menu item, but you can
always return to your original style in the VizMapper panel of Cytoscape.</p>
<p class="last">This menu item remains disabled until you start the ClusterONE plugin
using the corresponding menu item.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="control-panel">
<h1>Control panel</h1>
<p>The control panel of ClusterONE is to be found on a separate tab in the
control panel of Cytoscape (see the left hand side of the Cytoscape user
interface). The panel consists of two large parts: the <a class="reference internal" href="#parameters">Parameters</a> box lets
you set the parameters of the algorithm (this is subdivided into <a class="reference internal" href="#basic-parameters">Basic
parameters</a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#advanced-parameters">Advanced parameters</a>), while the <a class="reference internal" href="#selection-info">Selection info</a> box lets
you examine some properties of the currently selected set of nodes (such as the
total weight of edges within the set and at the boundary of the set, or the
value of the ClusterONE quality function).</p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Start</strong> button at the bottom of the panel to start the clustering
process. The <a class="reference internal" href="#result-viewer">result viewer</a> will open automatically when the results are ready.
Use the <strong>Close panel</strong> button to hide the ClusterONE control panel.</p>
<p>After a successful clustering process, the nodes of the network will be colored
according to the number of clusters they participate in. Nodes that correspond
to a single cluster only will turn red, nodes with multiple clusters will turn
yellow. Gray nodes denote outliers (nodes that did not end up in any of the
clusters).  This coloring is implemented using a custom VizMapper style. The
style is selected automatically when the clustering process finishes, but you
can always return to your original style in the VizMapper panel of Cytoscape.</p>
<div class="section" id="parameters">
<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>The parameters are grouped into basic and advanced ones. In most of the cases,
the default values of the advanced parameters should be fine, but the basic
parameters may need to be adjusted to your specific needs.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-parameters">
<h3>Basic parameters</h3>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Minimum size</strong></dt>
<dd>The minimum size of clusters deemed relevant by ClusterONE.
This is a hard threshold: whenever ClusterONE finds a cluster
smaller than the minimum size, the cluster will be discarded
immediately.</dd>
<dt><strong>Minimum density</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">The minimum density of clusters deemed relevant by ClusterONE.
The density of a cluster is the total sum of edge weights within
the cluster, divided by the number of theoretically possible
edges within the cluster. In other words, this is the average edge
weight within the cluster if missing edges are assumed to have a
weight of zero. Whenever ClusterONE finds a cluster that has a
smaller density than the value given here, the cluster will be
discarded immediately. Increase the minimum density if you get
too many clusters and they seem too sparse, or decrease it if you
are not getting enough clusters.</p>
<p class="last">Since version 0.93, ClusterONE also includes an automatic density
threshold selection method, which was tuned on various protein-protein
interaction datasets. When the &quot;Auto&quot; value is selected in the minimum
density field (this can be selected by trying to choose a density
threshold smaller than zero), ClusterONE will use a density threshold
of 0.3 for weighted networks and 0.5 for unweighted networks. If the
network is unweighted and the global clustering coefficient is smaller
than 0.1, ClusterONE will assume that the network was determined from
low-throughput experimental data (e.g., yeast-two-hybrid experiments)
and use a higher threshold of 0.6 to compensate for the presence of
many tree-like subgraphs in the input.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Edge weights</strong></dt>
<dd>A numeric edge attribute to be used for the edge weights. <em>[unweighted]</em>
means that each edge will have a weight equal to 1. If you don't see the
name of the attribute in the list, click on the <strong>Refresh</strong> button
(<img alt="refresh" src="images/refresh.png" />) next to the combo box to re-scan the network for numeric edge
attributes. This is necessary when you added the edge attribute you are
looking for after you opened the ClusterONE control panel.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-parameters">
<h3>Advanced parameters</h3>
<p>If you do not see these parameters in the <a class="reference internal" href="#control-panel">control panel</a>, click on the
<strong>Advanced parameters</strong> label to expand the container holding them.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Node penalty</strong></dt>
<dd>Penalty value corresponding to each node. When you set this option to
a specific value <em>x</em>, ClusterONE will assume that each node has an
extra boundary weight of <em>x</em> when it considers the addition of the node
to a cluster (see <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id2">[1]</a> for more details). It can be used to model the
possibility of uncharted connections for each node, so nodes with only
a single weak connection to a cluster will not be added to the cluster as
the penalty value will outweigh the benefits of adding the node. The
default penalty value is 2.</dd>
<dt><strong>Merging method</strong>, <strong>Overlap threshold</strong> and <strong>Similarity function</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">After an initial set of clusters are found, ClusterONE tries to
merge highly overlapping (and thus redundant) clusters in order to
clean up the result. For each pair of clusters found, ClusterONE
calculates a score that quantifies the overlap between them, and
two clusters are merged if this overlap is larger than a given
threshold (specified by the <strong>Overlap threshold</strong> textbox). There
are four different ways to calculate the overlap score, as controlled
by the <strong>Similarity function</strong> combobox:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>match coefficient</em> takes the size of the overlap squared,
divided by the product of the sizes of the two clusters being
considered, as in the paper of Bader and Hogue <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id3">[2]</a>.</li>
<li>The <em>Simpson coefficient</em> divides the size of the overlap
by the size of the smaller cluster.</li>
<li>The <em>Jaccard similarity</em> divides the size of the overlap by the
size of the union of the two clusters.</li>
<li>The <em>Dice similarity</em> divides twice the size of the overlap by
the sum of the sizes of the two clusters.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Merging can be done in two different ways, as controlled by the
<strong>Merging method</strong> combobox:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The <em>single-pass method</em> calculates similarity scores between all pairs
of complexes and creates a graph where the nodes are the
complexes and two nodes are connected if the corresponding
complexes have a score higher than the overlap threshold.
Complexes in the same connected component of the graph will then
be merged.</li>
<li>The <em>multi-pass method</em> calculates similarity scores between all pairs
of complexes and stores those pairs that have a score
larger than the overlap threshold. The highest scoring pair
is then merged and the similarity of the merged complex
towards its neighbors is re-calculated. This is repeated
until there are no more highly overlapping complexes in
the result.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p class="last">The default settings (match coefficient with a threshold of 0.8 using
the single-pass algorithm) seem to be satisfactory for most use-cases
Decreasing the threshold will result in more clusters being merged.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Seeding method</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">ClusterONE works by growing clusters from initial &quot;seeds&quot;, driven
by a goal function that is maximized greedily (see the Cluster
ONE paper <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id4">[1]</a> for more details). A seed can be an arbitrary subgraph,
but in most cases, it is either a single node or a single edge.
The seeding method prescribes how the seeds are selected during the
calculation:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>From every node</em> means that every node will be used as a seed.</li>
<li><em>From unused nodes</em> means that nodes will be tried in the
descending order of their weights (where the weight of a node is
the sum of the weights on its incident edges), and whenever a
cluster is found, the nodes in that cluster will be excluded from
the list of potential seeds. In other words, the node with the
largest weight that does <em>not</em> participate in any of the clusters
found so far will be selected as the next seed.</li>
<li><em>From every edge</em> means that every edge will be considered once,
each yielding a seed consisting of the two endpoints of the edge.</li>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Number of nodes</strong></dt>
<dd>The number of nodes in the cluster.</dd>
<dt><strong>In-weight</strong></dt>
<dd>The sum of the weights of the edges that lie completely within the cluster.</dd>
<dt><strong>Out-weight</strong></dt>
<dd>The sum of the weights of the edges where one endpoint lies within the cluster
and the other lies outside.</dd>
<dt><strong>Density</strong></dt>
<dd>The density of the cluster; that is, the sum of the edge weights within
the cluster divided by the number of theoretically possible edges.</dd>
<dt><strong>Quality</strong></dt>
<dd>The quality of the cluster, as measured by the in-weight divided by the
sum of the in-weight and the out-weight. The rationale behind this measure
is that a good cluster contains many heavyweight edges within the cluster
itself, and it is connected to the rest of the network only by a few lightweight
edges. If the penalty value set in the <a class="reference internal" href="#advanced-parameters">Advanced parameters</a> panel is larger
than zero, the out-weight of the cluster will be increased by the penalty
value times the number of nodes in the cluster accordingly.</dd>
<dt><strong>P-value</strong></dt>
<dd>The p-value of a one-sided Mann-Whitney U test performed on the in-weights
and out-weights of the vertices. A low p-value means that the in-weights
are significantly larger than the out-weights, so it is more likely that the
cluster is a valid finding and not the result of random fluctuations.
Color codes also help distinguishing significant results from insignificant
ones: p-values less than 0.05 are denoted by red colors and p-values
between 0.05 and 0.1 are shown in yellow.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that the Mann-Whitney U test cannot be performed sensibly when all the
in-weights and out-weights are equal. In this case, the p-value will show &quot;NA&quot;.</p>

<h1>Result viewer</h1>
<p>The result viewer appears on the right hand side of the Cytoscape user
interface after a successful clustering process and it can operate in two
modes: the <a class="reference internal" href="#simple-view">simple view</a> and the <a class="reference internal" href="#detailed-view">detailed view</a>. When the result viewer is
opened for the first time, the <a class="reference internal" href="#simple-view">simple view</a> is used, which shows each cluster
in a scrollable list box along with some basic properties of the cluster
(number of nodes, density, quality and p-value). The clusters are ordered
according to ascending p-values.  There is also a small <a class="reference internal" href="#toolbar">toolbar</a> above the list
of clusters, where the number of clusters are shown along with small push
buttons to access some of the functionality provided by the result viewer.</p>
<div class="section" id="simple-view">
<h2>Simple view</h2>
<p>The simple view uses two columns, the first column showing a schematic drawing of
each cluster (driven by a simple force-directed layout algorithm) and the second
showing some basic properties of the cluster. The clusters are drawn in the
background, so if there are many large clusters, you may have to wait a little bit
until you are able to see them all.</p>
<p>Right-clicking on any row of the table will bring up the <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-context-menu">cluster context menu</a>.
Double-clicking on any row will extract the cluster into a separate Cytoscape
network view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="detailed-view">
<h2>Detailed view</h2>
<p>The detailed view can be turned on or off by clicking on the first button of
the toolbar which shows a table (<img alt="details" src="images/details.png" />). It is advised to turn the detailed
view on only if the result panel itself is detached from the main Cytoscape
window or if it is wide enough, as the detailed view contains seven columns,
the first showing a schematic drawing of the cluster itself, while the remaining
six correspond to the properties seen earlier in the <a class="reference internal" href="#selection-info">selection info</a> box
on the <a class="reference internal" href="#control-panel">control panel</a> (number of nodes, density, in-weight, out-weight,
quality and p-value).</p>
<p>In the detailed view, you can sort the clusters according to any of the above
columns by clicking on the column header. Clicking on the header again reverses
the order.</p>
<p>Right-clicking on any row of the table will bring up the <a class="reference internal" href="#cluster-context-menu">cluster context menu</a>.
Double-clicking on any row will extract the cluster into a separate Cytoscape
network view.</p>

<dt><img alt="find" src="images/find.png" /> <strong>Find clusters of selected nodes</strong></dt>
<dd>By clicking this button, ClusterONE will evaluate all the nodes that are
selected in the current Cytoscape network and select the clusters in which
at least one of the selected nodes participate. It can primarily be used
to find the cluster(s) of a single node after selecting that node in the
main Cytoscape panel.</dd>

<dd>Saves the clustering to disk in a file. You can choose between a simple

the format used by the GenePro plugin.</dd>

<h2>Cluster context menu</h2>
<p>This menu pops up whenever you right-click on a row in the results panel.
If there are multiple rows selected in the result set, the operations will
apply to all of them, otherwise they will apply to only the one you have
clicked on.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Copy to clipboard</strong></dt>
<dd>This menu item copies the IDs of the nodes in the selected clusters to
the clipboard. If there are multiple clusters selected, one line
in the copied text will correspond to one cluster. After copying,
you can paste the IDs to a text editor or a word processor.</dd>
<dt><strong>Extract selected cluster(s)</strong></dt>
<dd>Creates a new Cytoscape network from the subnetwork spanned by the
nodes in the selected clusters. Even when multiple clusters are
selected, only a single Cytoscape network will be created that includes
all the nodes in all the selected clusters. This command can also
be invoked for a single cluster by double-clicking on the cluster
in the result list.</dd>
<dt><strong>Save selected cluster(s)</strong></dt>
<dd>Saves the selected clusters into a text file in formats similar to
the ones handled by the <strong>Copy to clipboard</strong> operation (either a
plain text based format or the GenePro format).</dd>
<dt><strong>Remove</strong></dt>
<dd>Removes the selected clusters from the result list.</dd>
